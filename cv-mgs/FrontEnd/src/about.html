I chose to present my CV as a web page because I believe this format best reflects my practical skills, my mindset, and my willingness to learn through real projects rather than relying solely on traditional documents.</p>
                            <p>At the moment, I am focused on developing my front-end skills, working with technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces. I pay close attention to structure, layout, and user experience, aiming to understand how design and functionality work together to deliver clear and intuitive digital solutions.</p>
                            <p>I strongly believe that continuous learning is essential in the tech industry. For this reason, I actively seek opportunities to improve my knowledge, experiment with new ideas, and better understand how things work behind the scenes. This web-based CV represents not only a personal introduction, but also a reflection of my learning process and professional mindset. It serves as a starting point in my development as a web developer, highlighting my commitment to growth, consistency, and hands-on experience.</p>
